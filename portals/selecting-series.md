## Database Schema

The Widget configuration syntax provides a way to load and display data for time series stored in a database. Series values
change over time and their history is visualized with different types of graphs.

```ls
[widget]
  type = chart
# Widget settings
  [series]
# Series 1 settings
  [series]
# Series 2 settings
```

Each series is identified by a composite key which consists of a **metric**, **entity**, and optional name/value pairs called **series tags**, or simply **tags**.

```ls
  [series]
    metric = cpu_busy
    entity = nurswgvml007
  [series]
    metric = df.bytes.percentused
    entity = nurswgvml006
    [tags]
      mount = /
      fstype = ext4
```

* An **entity** is a physical or logical object being monitored such as `nurswgvml007` (computer name).

* A **metric** represents the name of a measurable numeric attribute such as `cpu_busy` or `temperature`.

* **Series Tags** are optional. They provide additional level of detail for measurements, for example the diskâ€™s mount point for the `df.bytes.percentused` metric.

An entity may be measured with a variety of metrics, just as the same metric could be collected for multiple entities.

## Exploring Series

Available series can be searched on the **Series** tab in the main menu.

Alternatively, if the entity is already known, the metrics and series can be explored via a portal containing drop-down selectors.

## Selecting Specific Series

To display values for a specific series, specify the exact series key in the `[series]` section:

```ls
  # Series without Tags
  metric = cpu_busy
  entity = nurswgvml007
```

![](./resources/selecting-series_1.png)

```ls
  # Series with Tags
  metric = df.bytes.percentused
  entity = nurswgvml006
  [tags]
    mount = /
    fstype = ext4
```

## Selecting Multiple Series with Tags

By default, the database returns all series matching the request, including series with extra tags not enumerated in the request.

This enables loading series using only a subset of tags that are still sufficient to uniquely identify the series:

```ls
  # Series with Tags
  metric = df.bytes.percentused
  entity = nurswgvml006
  [tags]
    mount = /
```

The above configuration matches all series with `mount=/` tag, **including** series that may have other tags.

To disable partial tag match, use the `exact-match = true | false` setting:

```ls
  # Series with Tags
  metric = df.bytes.percentused
  entity = nurswgvml006
  exact-match = true
  [tags]
    mount = /
```

When partial match is disabled, the database returns series with exactly the same combination of tags as specified in
the request.

The partial match, while making the configuration compact, can produce undetermined results if the partial key matches multiple
series where only one series is expected:

```ls
  # Series with Tags
  metric = df.bytes.percentused
  entity = nurswgvml006
  [tags]
    fstype = ext4
```

In the above example, the response contains three different series with the same file system type ext4 but with different
mount points: `/`, `/boot/`, `/media/datadrive`.

The resulting series is merged from 3 underlying different series and provides a meaningless result in this case.

To control how multiple matched series are processed, use the `multiple-series = true | false` setting.

```ls
  # Display all series with tag fstype=ext4 without merging
  multiple-series = true
  [series]
    [tags]
      fstype = ext4
```

The `multiple-series` setting can be used to display all series without specifying any tags in widget configuration at all:

```ls
   # Display all series without merging
     multiple-series = true
     [series]
```

The default value of the `multiple-series` setting is `true` in the following cases:

* Multiple entities are specified, for example `entity = nur1, nur2`

* Multiple tag values are specified, for example `[tags] mount = /, /tmp`

* Entity name contains wildcard, for example `entity = nur*`

* Tag value contains wildcard, for example `[tags] mount = /t*`

* `entity-expression`, `entity-group`, or `tag-expression` is present

```ls
# Select series using tag value wildcards. multiple-series is TRUE
  [tags]
    fstype = ext4
    mount = *media*

# Select series with any value for the specified tag. multiple-series is TRUE
  [tags]
    fstype = ext4
    mount = *

# Select series with any value for the specified tag. multiple-series is FALSE
  [tags]
    fstype = ext4

# Select series with tag values from the specified list. multiple-series is TRUE
  [tags]
    fstype = cifs, autofs

# Select series with tag values matching specified wildcard patterns: multiple-series is TRUE
  [tags]
    fstype = cifs, auto*

# Select series with tags matching an expression: multiple-series is TRUE
  tag-expression = tags.mount NOT LIKE '/m*'
```

## Merging Series

Joining multiple series with different tags into one series is useful when some of the tags can be ignored.

```txt
               date                 metric          entity                   tags     value
2018-06-15 00:00:00   df.bytes.percentused    nurswgvml006    mount=/,fstype=ext3      10.2    <- series-1
2018-06-15 01:00:00   df.bytes.percentused    nurswgvml006    mount=/,fstype=ext3      10.3    <- series-1
2018-06-15 02:00:00   df.bytes.percentused    nurswgvml006    mount=/,fstype=ext4      10.1    <- series-2
2018-06-15 03:00:00   df.bytes.percentused    nurswgvml006    mount=/,fstype=ext4      10.2    <- series-2
```

In the previous example, the underlying series do not overlap and can be merged without duplication.

```txt
               date                 metric          entity       tags     value
2018-06-15 00:00:00   df.bytes.percentused    nurswgvml006    mount=/      10.2    <- series-3
2018-06-15 01:00:00   df.bytes.percentused    nurswgvml006    mount=/      10.3    <- series-3
2018-06-15 02:00:00   df.bytes.percentused    nurswgvml006    mount=/      10.1    <- series-3
2018-06-15 03:00:00   df.bytes.percentused    nurswgvml006    mount=/      10.2    <- series-3
```

Examples:

* `/media/datadrive` file system re-mounted on a larger disk but the mount point remains the same.

* Containers with different identifiers launched on schedule to perform a daily task with the same name.

* Measurements recorded for scientific experiments and tags contain experiment ID and input parameters.

## Selecting Series for Multiple Entities

The `[widget]` syntax provides a number of options to select series for multiple entities and the same metric:

```ls
  # Select specific entity by name
  entity = nurswgvml006

  # Select multiple entities by name using ? and * wildcards
  entity = nurswgvml*

  # Select all entities
  entity = *

  # Select an array of entities by name
  entities = nurswgvml006, nurswgvml007

  # Select an array of entities by name or pattern
  entities = nurswgvml111, nurswgvml00*

  # Select entities matching an expression referencing name, label, entity tags, properties
  entity-expression = tags.app = 'ATSD'

  # Select entities belonging to the specified entity group
  entity-group = nur-collectors
```

Refer to the [Data API](../api/data/filter-entity.md#entity-filter-fields) documentation for details on entity filters.

```ls
  # Retrieve series for entities starting with nurswgvml00
  [series]
   entity = nurswgvml00*
    [tags]
      mount = /
      fstype = ext4
```

## Retrieving Series from the Database

As an alternative to enumerating the `[series]` manually or using wildcards, the widget syntax provides the `getSeries()` and `getTags()` functions to retrieve series lists from the metadata endpoints.

`getTags()` function:

```ls
  var tags = getTags('df.bytes.percentused', 'mount', 'nurswgvml006')

  for tagValue in tags
    [series]
      [tags]
        mount = @{tagValue}
  endfor
```

`getSeries()` function:

```ls
  var seriesList = getSeries('df.bytes.percentused', 'nurswgvml006')

  for sobj in seriesList
    [series]
      [tags]
      for tagName in Object.keys(sobj.tags)
        "@{tagName}" = @{sobj.tags[tagName]}
      endfor
  endfor
```

## Controlling Displayed Series

The `series-limit = int` setting enables limiting the number of possible series returned by the database for wildcard queries.
Since the limit is applied to matched series before sorting, the results may vary between requests, which makes the setting
useful when exploring the dataset to prevent the widgets from loading too many series into browser memory.

```ls
  entity = *
  series-limit = 10
  [series]
    [tags]
      fstype = ext4
```

For a more flexible visibility control on the client, use the display and enabled settings.

```ls
  entity = *
  display = value == top(1) || value == bottom(1)
  [series]
    [tags]
      fstype = ext4
```

![](./resources/series-display-1.png)

In addition, the `limit = int` setting can reduce the number of samples displayed for each series. It makes queries
execute faster when loading data for high-frequency series from the server, in particular during design and validation stages.
