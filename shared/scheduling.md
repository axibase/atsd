# Scheduling

Forecasts, SQL queries, data export jobs, and administrative tasks can be run on schedule according to a `cron` expression. The schedules are listed on the **Settings > Server Properties** page.

## Syntax

Fields in a `cron` expression have the following order:

* seconds
* minutes
* hours
* day-of-month
* month
* day-of-week

For example, `0 0 8 * * ?` means that the task is executed at `08:00:00` every day.

```txt
seconds minutes hours day-of-month month day-of-week
   0       0      8        *         *        ?
```

Either `0` or `7` can be used for Sunday in the `day-of-week` field.

## Time Zone

The `cron` expression is evaluated based on the time zone of the server where the database is running.

The time zone is displayed on the **Settings > System Information** page.

## Examples

**Expression** | **Description**
:---|:---
`0/10 * * * * ?` | Every 10 seconds.
`0 0/15 * * * ?` | Every 15 minutes.
`0 * * * * ?` | Every minute.
`0 0 0 * * ?` | Every day at 0:00.
`0 5,35 * * * ?` | Every hour at 5th and 35th minute.
