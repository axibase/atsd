# SQL Report Scheduling

SQL scheduler allows for SQL query reports to be generated at pre-determined times of the day.

The frequency is controlled with the **Schedule** field specifying a `cron` expression that determines when the task should be executed.

For instructions and examples about scheduling SQL queries with `cron` expressions, see [Scheduling](../shared/scheduling.md).
