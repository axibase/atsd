# Window

## Overview

A window is an in-memory structure created by the rule engine for each unique combination of metric, entity, and grouping tags extracted from incoming commands.

Windows are displayed on the **Alerts > Rule Windows** page.

## Window Length

### CountÂ Based Windows

Count-based windows accumulate up to the specified number of samples. The samples are sorted in **order of arrival**, with the most recently received sample placed at the end of the array. When the window is full, the first (oldest by arrival time) sample is removed from the window to free up space at the end of the array for an incoming sample.

### Time Based Windows

Time-based windows store samples that were recorded within the specified interval of time and as such they don't limit how many samples are stored in the window. 

The start of the interval is initially set to current time minus the window length, and is constantly incremented as the time goes by. Such windows are often called _sliding_ windows. If the timestamp of the incoming command is equal or greater than the start time, the command is added to the window.

> The **end** time in time-based windows is not set (in particular, it is not set to current time) and the window will accept commands with future timestamps unless they're discarded with the [Time filter](filters.md#time-filter) or [filter expression](filters.md#filter-expression) such as `timestamp <= now.getMillis() + 60000`.

Old commands are automatically removed from the window once their timestamp is earlier than the window start time.

## Window Status

The response actions are triggered on window status events.

As the new data is received and old data is removed from the window, the rule engine re-evaluates the condition which can cause the status of the current window to change, triggering response actions.

### Initial Status

New windows are created based on incoming data and no historical data is loaded from the database, unless 'Load History' setting is turned on.

The window for the given [grouping](grouping.md) key is created when the first matching command is received by the rule engine.

The new windows are assigned initial status of `CANCEL` which is then updated based on the results of the boolean (`true` or `false`) condition.

### Lifecycle

All windows for the current rule are deleted from memory if the rule is deleted as well as when it's modified and saved in the editor.

### Triggers

The response actions can be triggered whenever the window changes its status as well as at scheduled intervals when the status is `REPEAT`. The triggers for each action type are configured and executed separately.

### Status Events

| Previous State | New Status | Previous Condition Value | New Condition Value | Trigger Supported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CANCEL` | `OPEN` | `false` | `true` | Yes |
| `OPEN`  | `REPEAT` | `true` | `true` | Yes |
| `REPEAT` | `REPEAT` | `true` | `true` | Yes |
| `OPEN` | `CANCEL` | `true` | `false` | Yes |
| `REPEAT` | `CANCEL` | `true` | `false` | Yes |
| `CANCEL` | `CANCEL` | `false` | `false` | No |

### `OPEN` Status

The `OPEN` status is assigned to the window when the condition changes value from `false` to `true`.

### `REPEAT` Status

The `REPEAT` status is assigned to an `OPEN` window when the condition returns `true` based on the second received command.

When the window is in `REPEAT` status, the actions can be executed with the frequency specified in the rule editor.

### `CANCEL` Status

`CANCEL` is the initial status assigned to new windows. It is also assigned to the window when the condition changes from `true` to `false` or when the window is destroyed on rule modification.

Windows in `CANCEL` status do not trigger _repeat_ actions. Such behavior can be emulated by creating a rule with a negated expression which returns `true` instead of `false` for the same condition.

The window can change to `CANCEL` status when the condition changes from `true` to `false` as well as when the rule is modified, deleted, or the database is orderly shutdown. `On Cancel` triggers are not invoked, even if enabled, when the rule is modified/deleted or in case of shutdown.  This behavior is controlled with `cancel.on.rule.change` server property.

## Window Fields

The window fields can be included in the [condition](condition.md), [filter](filters.md) and [variables](variables.md).

### Message Fields

|**Name**|**Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
| type | string | Message type (also `tags.type`) |
| source | string | Message type (also `tags.source`) |
| message | string | Message text |

> The `tags` map for the `message` command contains `type`, `source`, `severity`, and other command tags.

> Alert `severity` value is inherited from message `severity` when the Logging: Severity is set to 'Undefined'.

### Properties Fields

|**Name**|**Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
| type | string | Property type (same as `tags.type`) |
| keys | map | Property keys. To retrieve key value, use `keys.{name}` |
| properties | map | Property tags. To retrieve tag value, use `properties.{name}` |

> The `tags` map for the `property` command contains the `keys` map and the `type` field.

### Time Fields

**Name**|**Time Zone**|**Description**
:---|---|:---
`alert_open_time` | Server | Time when the window changed status to `OPEN`
`alert_open_datetime` | UTC | Time when the window changed status to `OPEN`

`now` | Server | Current server time as a [DateTime](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/DateTime.html) object.
`alert_duration` | n/a | Interval between current time and alert open time, formatted as `days:hours:minutes:seconds`, for example `00:00:01:45`.
`alert_duration_interval` | n/a | Interval between current time and alert open time, formatted as `alert_duration` with units, for example `1m:45s`.

> Fields ending with `_time` contain time in local server timezone, for example `2017-05-30 14:05:39 PST`.

> Fields ending with `_datetime` contain time in ISO 8601 format in UTC timezone, for example `2017-05-30T06:05:39Z`.

> If 'Check On Exit' option is enabled for time-based window, some of the events will be caused by exiting commands and the `timestamp` placeholder will return the time of the command being remove (oldest command), rounded to seconds.

> The `now` object's fields can be accessed with `get` methods, e.g. `now.getDayOfWeek() == 4`.
