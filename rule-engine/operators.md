# Operators

## Boolean Operators

| **Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `OR` | Boolean OR, also `\|\|`. |
| `AND` | Boolean AND, also `&&`. |
| `NOT` | Boolean NOT, also `!`. |

```javascript
  value > 90 && avg() > 50
```

```javascript
  tags.file_system LIKE '/opt/*' OR tags.file_system LIKE '/mnt/*'
```

```javascript
  NOT tags.isEmpty()
```		
```
## Ternary Operator

| **Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `?:` | Ternary conditional |

The ternary `?:` operator simplifies the syntax of a boolean conditional, but expands the functionality. The example below has a binary query (`==`) and subsequent conditional action based of the results of that query.

Example:

```javascript
   tags.mount_point == '/' ? 90.0 : 75.0
```  

The above example is equivalent to:

```javascript
  if (tags.mount_point == '/') {
     return 90.0;
  } else {
     return 75.0;
  }
```

## Numeric Operators

| **Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `+` | Plus. |
| `-` | Minus. |
| `*` | Multiply. |
| `/` | Divide. |
| `%` | Remainder. |
| `=` | Equal. Also `==`. |
| `!=` | Not equal. |
| `>` | Greater than. |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal. |
| `<` | Less than. |
| `<=` | Less than or equal. |
| `BETWEEN` | `n BETWEEN m AND p`.<br>The number `n` is between `m` and `p` (inclusive).<br>`m <= n <= p`.<br>Example: `avg() BETWEEN 10 and 20`. |
| `IN` | Membership in collection. |

```javascript
  value*100 > 90
```

```javascript
  max() BETWEEN 80 and 100
```

## Text Operators

| **Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `=` | Also `==`. Equal. The comparison is case-**insensitive** ('a' = 'A' equals `true`).|
| `!=` | Not equal. The comparison is case-**insensitive** ('a' != 'A' equals `false`).|
| `BETWEEN` | `a BETWEEN b AND c`.<br>String `a` is between `b` and `c` (inclusive) using lexicographical comparison.<br>The comparison is case-**sensitive**.<br>Example: `timeStr BETWEEN '18:00' AND '18:04'`.|
| `LIKE` | Matches the string using `?` and `*` wildcards.|
| `IN` | Membership in collection. |

```javascript
  entity = 'nurswgvml007'
```

```javascript
  entity LIKE '*007'
```
