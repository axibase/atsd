Each window status event can produce only one AWS request.

The request is submitted to the specified AWS endpoint using the selected method with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type. The request includes additional AWS headers (`Authorization`, `X-Amz-Date`) and is signed with [AWS Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

## Response

The response status code and response content are recorded in `atsd.log` if the **Log Response** setting is enabled.

## Placeholders

[Placeholders](../placeholders.md) are supported in the Endpoint URL, request parameter names, and values.

Placeholders are substituted with actual field values when the request is initiated.

If the placeholder does not exist, the placeholder substituted with an empty string.

Placeholder values are automatically URL-encoded if they are included in the request URL.

## Parameters

If the checkbox on the left is disabled, the parameter is fixed and cannot be modified in the rule editor.

Otherwise, if the checkbox enabled, the parameter is displayed on the **Webhooks** tab in the rule editor.

Both fixed and editable parameter values can include placeholders.
