# Versioning

Versioning enables tracking of time-series value changes for the purpose of enabling an audit trail and traceable data reconciliation. Once enabled, ATSD tracks changes made to stored values with the following versioning fields:

| Field Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Version Time  |  Timestamp when the insert command was received. Set automatically by the ATSD server with millisecond precision.  | 
|  Version Source  |  User-defined field to track sources (origins) of change events such as username, device id, or IP address.<br>Set to `user:{username}` by default for changes made through the ATSD web interface.  | 
|  Version Status  |  User-defined field to classify change events.<br>Set to `Invalid` code if an inserted value triggers an Invalid Value Action. Set to `SET_VERSION_STATUS` in metric editor.  | 


#### Enabling Versioning

Versioning is disabled by default. It can be enabled for particular metrics by selecting the Versioning checkbox on the Metric Editor page:

In addition, the Invalid Value Action can be set to `SET_VERSION_STATUS` to initialize the Version Status field to an 'invalid' value if the inserted sample is outside of the specified minimum and maximum bounds.

#### Inserting Version Fields: Network Commands

To insert versioning fields, use the reserved series tags `version_source` and `version_status`. These tags will be removed by the server to populate corresponding versioning fields. If the sample value is outside of minimum and maximum bounds specified in the metric editor, `version_status` will be set to 'Invalid'.

Note that if metric is unversioned, the `version_source` and `version_status` tags will be processed as regular tags.

#### Inserting Versions with CSV Parser using Default Tags

If all records in a CSV file should have the same versioning fields, specify `version_source` and `version_status` in Default Tags.

Note that the `version_source` and `version_status` tags will be applied only to metrics that are enabled for versioning. These reserved tags will be ignored for unversioned metrics.

#### Inserting Versions with CSV Parser using Renamed Columns

To extract versioning fields from CSV file columns, add the `version_source` and `version_status` to Tag Columns and specify mappings between the original column names and reserved tag names in the Renamed Columns field.

Note that the `version_source` and `version_status` tags will be applied only to metrics that are enabled for versioning. These reserved tags will be ignored for unversioned metrics.

#### Viewing Versions

Version history can be retrieved on the Ad-hoc Export page or via a scheduled export job.

Click on the Versioning checkbox to view version history on the Ad-hoc Export page:

- Records with version history are highlighted with blue and brown-colored borders.
- Blue border represents the latest value. Brown border represents a historical, overwritten value.
- NaN (Not a Number) represents deleted values. Deleted values are excluded from aggregation functions.
- For the purpose of API requests, aggregation functions, and other calculations, historical values and deleted values are ignored.


#### Viewing Versions with Filters


- Click on the 'Revisions Only' checkbox to display only values with version history. Values that havenâ€™t been modified will be hidden.
- To display deleted values, enter `Double.isNaN(value)` into the Value Filter field.
- To filter version history, enter an expression into the Version Filter containing the `version_source`, `version_status`, and `version_time` fields. Note that the `version_time` field supports endtime syntax with the `date()`` function.
` version_source LIKE 'api*'`
` version_status = 'revised'`
` version_time > date('2015-08-13 00:00:00') AND version_time < date('previous_day')`


#### Updating Series Value

Create a report in HTML format on the Ad-hoc Export page with the Versioning mode enabled.

Click on Timestamp for the selected record to open the Data Entry page.

Set version Status and Source, change the value, and click Update.

#### Deleting Series Value

Create a report in HTML format on Ad-hoc Export page, with Versioning mode enabled.

Click on Timestamp for the selected record, optionally modify Status and Source, and click the [Delete] button to delete the value.

Note that the value will not be actually deleted. Rather, the current value for the selected timestamp will be replaced with a NaN (Not a Number) marker.

#### Deleting Multiple Series Values

To delete multiple values, select checkboxes for the selected rows or click the top checkbox to select all rows, and then click Delete.

#### Scheduled Version Reports

Open the Scheduled Export editor, click the Versioning checkbox, and optionally limit the report only to modified values by checking the 'Revision Only' field.
