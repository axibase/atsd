# Monitoring

ATSD performance metrics can be retrieved via JMX, read from a plain text file, or retrieved from an HTTP endpoint in JSON format.

The metrics are updated at a regular interval and can be used to monitor
the database state and the status of its individual components, such as the
amount of data received, memory usage, and read/write throughput.

Example: [Disk Space monitoring](data_retention.md#disk-space-monitoring)

You can access the metrics using the following methods:

* [JMX in JSON format](monitoring-metrics/json.md)
* [JMX](monitoring-metrics/jmx.md)
* [File](monitoring-metrics/file.md)
* [Rule Engine](monitoring-metrics/rule-engine.md)
* [Incoming Data Statistics](monitoring-metrics/ingestion-statistics.md)
* [Database Tables](monitoring-metrics/database-tables.md)
* [I/O Tests](monitoring-metrics/io-tests.md)
* [HBase Write Test](monitoring-metrics/hbase-write-test.md)
* [Portals](monitoring-metrics/portals.md)

## Example
