# Monitoring

ATSD performance metrics can be retrieved via JMX, file, or a http/JSON
request.

These metrics are updated every 15 to 60 seconds and can be used to monitor
the database state and the status of its individual components, such as the
amount of data received, memory usage, and read/write activity.

You can retrieve, test, or view the metrics using the following methods:

* [JMX in JSON format](monitoring-metrics/json.md)
* [JMX](monitoring-metrics/jmx.md)
* [File](monitoring-metrics/file.md)
* [Rule Engine](monitoring-metrics/rule-engine.md)
* [Incoming Data Statistics](monitoring-metrics/ingestion-statistics.md)
* [Database Tables](monitoring-metrics/database-tables.md)
* [I/O Tests](monitoring-metrics/io-tests.md)
* [HBase Write Test](monitoring-metrics/hbase-write-test.md)
* [Portals](monitoring-metrics/portals.md)
