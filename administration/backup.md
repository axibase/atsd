# Backup and Restore ATSD

This article describes creating a backup of [configuration records](#configuration-records) and [data](#data) in ATSD.

## Configuration Records

The database performs a backup for the following configuration types:

* [CSV Parsers](../parsers/csv/README.md)
* [Entities](../README.md#glossary)
* [Entity Groups](../configuration/entity_groups.md)
* [Entity Views](../configuration/entity_views.md)
* [Export Jobs](../reporting/scheduled-exporting.md#export-job-logging)
* [Export Queries](../sql/scheduled-sql.md)
* [Forecast Settings](../forecasting/README.md)
* [Metrics](../README.md#glossary)
* [Named Collections](../rule-engine/functions-random.md#named-collection)
* [Portals](../portals/README.md)
* [Replacement Tables](../sql/examples/lookup.md#replacement-tables)
* [Rules](../rule-engine/README.md#developing-rules)
* [Tag Templates](../configuration/tag-templates.md)
* [Users](./collector-account.md#create-user)
* [User Groups](./collector-account.md#create-user-group)
* [Web Configurations](../rule-engine/notifications/webhook.md)

> Configuration backup does not include [data tables](./data_retention.md#data-tables) containing series, properties, or messages. See [Data](#data) section for instructions on creating data backup.

The database performs a [scheduled backup](#configure-backup-schedule) each day at a specified time.

To reduce the amount of disk space used, backups of `metric` and `entity` types only contain records with non-default settings such as custom tags, labels, or field values.

### Manual Backup

Open the **Settings > Diagnostics > Backup Files** page.

Click **Backup** to create a new backup manually. New backup files appear in the **Backup Files** table alongside **Last Modified** and **Size, KB** information.

Download individual backup archives by clicking the link in the **Name** column or copy the files from the `/opt/atsd/atsd/backup` directory. The name of the archive contains the date when the backup was generated.

### Scheduled Backup

The [**Server Properties**](./server-properties.md) page contains the `internal.backup.schedule` property. By default, the database creates backup files in the `/opt/atsd/atsd/backup` directory every day at 23:30 [local server time](./timezone.md). Configure the [`cron`](https://axibase.com/docs/axibase-collector/scheduling.html#cron-expressions) expression as needed to modify this schedule.

New backup files do not replace existing backup files. Each backup is timestamped with the date and time of creation. 

Configure an external `cron` job to prune old backup files and to move records to a different location.

### Restore

The records in the selected backup archive can be restored in the same ATSD instance or in another ATSD instance.

Choose one or multiple backup file to revert ATSD records to an earlier date if a record is deleted erroneously. Alternatively, import records to another ATSD instance to replicate a configuration.

Open the **Settings > Diagnostics > Backup Import** page.

Upload the desired backup files by clicking **Choose Files**. If needed, select multiple files. Click **Import** to restore records from the selected backup files.

**Backup Import** has two optional settings:

* **Replace Existing** setting instructs the database to replace existing records with new records in case of match. If disabled, and matching records exist in the database, the database retains existing records unchanged and ignores matching records in the backup file.
* **Auto Enable** setting controls whether or not uploaded records are [enabled](./data_retention.md#disable-metric) by default.

## Data

### Replication

To replicate data to another database instance, follow the instructions in the [Replication](./replication.md) guide.

### Base Directory Copy

This method involves copying files on the local file system and only applies to [standalone](../installation/README.md#packages) installations.

Stop ATSD.

```sh
/opt/atsd/bin/atsd-all.sh stop
```

Copy the `/opt/atsd` directory to the backup directory.

```sh
cp -a /opt/atsd/  /path/to/backup-dir
```

Start ATSD.

```sh
/opt/atsd/bin/atsd-all.sh start
```

### HBase Backup

Perform a backup to another HDFS cluster using the underlying HBase [Backup and Restore](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#backuprestore) functionality.
