# Monitoring Metrics using the HBase Write Test

The HBase Write Test can be run directly from the ATSD user interface under **Settings > Diagnostics > I/O Tests**.

HBase Write TestÂ allows you to:

* Analyze the data being ingested, for example the number of unique
    metric/entity/tag combinations, and run a write throughput test.
* Launch an Auto Test to view a matrix of throughput statistics for
    different batch sizes and thread count combinations.
* Apply test results to modify the default configuration parameters in
    the ATSD `server.properties` file:

```elm
series.batch.size = 1024
series.queue.pool.size = 4
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Entity prefix | Entity name prefix. |
| Metric prefix | Metric name prefix. |
| Entities count | Number of unique entities to store. |
| Metrics count | Number of unique metrics to store. |
| Series count | Total number of series to store. |
