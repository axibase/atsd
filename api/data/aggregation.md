## Implementation Notes

### General

The descriptive statistics are calculated for all samples in the given period. If the period contains no samples, the statistic is not calculated and is not included in the response.

### `COUNT`

Like other functions, `COUNT` is not calculated if the period contains no samples. Specifically, it does **not** return zero values for empty periods.

### `DELTA`

The `DELTA` function returns the difference between the last value in the current period and the last value in the **previous** period.

* If the previous period contains no values, the function is calculated as the difference between the last and the first value in the current period.
* If there is only one value in the current period and the previous period is empty, the function returns `null` which is included in the response.

### `COUNTER`

The `COUNTER` function returns the sum of positive differences between consecutive samples in the current period starting with the last value in the **previous** period.

* If the previous period contains no values, the calculation starts with the first value in the current period.
* If there is only one value in the current period and the previous period is empty, the function returns `null` which is included in the response.
* If all the differences between consecutive samples are non-negative, the result of the `COUNTER` function is equal to the `DELTA` function.

### `STANDARD_DEVIATION`

Standard deviation is calculated as an unbiased estimator of variance for the `n - 1` sample as described in the NIST Engineering Handbook, Section 6.3.2.

### `PERCENTILE`

* The `percentile(n)` function returns the number which is greater than the specified percentage `n` of values in the given period.
* The `n` parameter must be within the `[0, 100]` range.
* `PERCENTILE(100)` = `MAX`.
* `PERCENTILE(97.5)` is equal to `97.5%` percentile.
* `PERCENTILE(50)` = `MEDIAN`.
* `PERCENTILE(0)` = `MIN`.
* The function implements the `R6` method as described in the NIST Engineering Handbook, Section 2.6.2, which uses `N+1` as the array size (`N` is the number of samples in the period) and performs linear interpolation between consecutive values.
* `NaN` values are ignored from the input array.
