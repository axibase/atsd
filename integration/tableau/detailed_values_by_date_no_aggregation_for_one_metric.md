#Detailed values by date (no aggregation) for one metric

There is example of visualization export statistics for several years.
 
We will need `bi.ex_net1.m` table:

- Drag-and-drop _Datetime_ to the columns field, change from YEAR aggregation to _Exact Date_ 
- Drag-and-drop _Value_ to the rows field, change from SUM aggregation to _Dimension_
- Select _Line_ in drop-down at Marks Card
- Optionally add [drop lines](comparision_of_two_metrics_at_one_bar_graph.md/#drop-lines)
