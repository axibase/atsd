# Data Applications

Axibase developed a set of data applications to demonstrate binding ATSD with [popular programming languages](https://axibase.com/use-cases/chart-of-the-day/stack-exchange/). These applications are released as open-source software under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). Use these [Sample Applications](https://apps.axibase.com/) as templates to develop custom applications with comprehensible ATSD Clients.
