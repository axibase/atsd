# Ad Hoc Exporting

Ad hoc exporting is an interactive interface to export historical data and forecasts in CSV and HTML formats.

## Ad hoc Export Settings

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
|  Export Type  |  Data Type: Historical or Forecast.  |
|  Metric  |  Metric name of exported data.<br>Data can be exported for one metric at a time.  |
|  Entity  |  If selected, exported data is limited to the specified entity.<br>Supersedes **Entity Group** field.  |
|  Entity Group  |  If selected, exported data is limited to entities contained in the specified entity group.<br>Supersedes **Entity Expression** field.  |
|  Entity Expression  |  Expression to filter selected data by entity name and entity tags.<br>For example: `name LIKE 'nur*' AND tags.environment = 'prod'`.  |
|  Tags  |  An optional set of series tag pairs.<br>For example, `file_system = /` for the `disk_used_percent` metric.<br>Note that series tags are inserted along with value, and are therefore different from entity and metric tags.<br>Wildcard symbols `*` and `?` are supported in tag values.  |
|  Value Filter  |  Expression to fetch only detailed samples that satisfy a condition.<br>For example, `value != 0`.<br>Value Filter is applied before aggregation and therefore impacts aggregated statistics values.<br>To filter deleted values, use the `Double.isNaN(value`) syntax.  |
|  Selection Interval  | Time period of exported data.<br>Optionally define the end of this period in the End Time field.<br>The default value is current time.<br>The Selection Interval setting is ignored if both the Start Time and End Time fields are set.  |
|  Start Time  |  Start time of the selection interval.<br>This field supports [calendar](../shared/calendar.md) keywords.<br>For example `previous_day`.<br>If not defined, Start Time is calculated as End Time minus the Selection Interval.  |
|  End Time  |  Selection period end time.<br>This field supports [calendar](../shared/calendar.md) keywords.<br>For example `next_day`.<br>If not defined, End Time is calculated as Start Time plus the Selection Interval.<br>If Start Time is not defined, End Time is set to current time.  |
|  Aggregate  |  Enable period aggregations based on the selected detailed samples, after the optional Value Filter is applied.  |
|  Aggregation Period  |  Period of time over which the detailed samples are aggregated.  |
|  Interpolation  |  Insert missing periods in aggregated results.<br>A period is considered to be missing if it contains no detailed samples.<br> Supported options:<br>`STEP` – Value of missing period equals value of the previous period.<br>`LINEAR` – Value is linearly interpolated between previous and next available value.<br>`NONE` – Missing periods are not inserted.   |
|  Aggregate Statistics  |  One or multiple aggregation functions:<br> average, minimum, maximum, sum, count, standard deviation, weighted average, weighted time average, median (percentile 50), first, last, percentile 50/75/90/95/99/99.5/99.9, `MinValueTime`, `MaxValueTime`.  |
|  Versioning  |  Display value history for metric that is enabled for Versioning.<br>Versioning is displayed only for detailed, non-aggregated samples.  |
|  Revisions Only  |  Filters displayed versions only for samples with values changes.<br>Excludes samples without versions.  |
|  Version Filter  |  Expression to filter value history (versions) by version value, status, source, or time.<br>For example: `(version_status = 'Deleted' OR version_source LIKE '*user*') AND NOT Double.isNaN(value)`.<br>To filter by version time, use the `date()` function.<br>For example, `version_time > date('2015-08-11T16:00:00Z') OR version_time > date('current_day')`. The `date()` function accepts [calendar](../shared/calendar.md) keywords.  |
|  Export Format  |  Export format – CSV or HTML.<br>If HTML is selected, number of rows can be limited with Row Limit setting.  |
|  Row Limit  |  Maximum Number of Rows displayed in HTML format.<br> Tables with greater than 10,000 rows are not recommended for HTML format.  |
|  Entity Tags  |  List of entity tags included as columns in the exported file/table.  |
|  Decimal Precision  |  Number of fractional digits displayed.<br>If a negative value such as `-1` is specified, stored numbers are displayed without formatting.  |
|  Time Format  |  Format for displaying series sample timestamps: Local Time (server time zone) or [ISO format](../shared/date-format.md) (UTC time).<br>Local = `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`<br>ISO = `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'`  |
