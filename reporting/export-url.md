## Interpolation Functions

Interpolation functions canÂ insert missing intervals in returned aggregated data:

| Function Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
|  `STEP`  |  Missing value equals previous (last) value.  |
| `LINEAR`  |  Missing value is computed using linear interpolation between previous (last) and next available value.  |
|  `NONE`  |  Missing values are not inserted.  |

If the interpolation function is not specified in the request, missing intervals are not created.
