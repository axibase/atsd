# Exporting Data

ATSD has two primary modes of data export: [Adhoc](ad-hoc-exporting.md) and [Scheduled](scheduled-exporting.md). Historical data and forecasts can be exported in CSV, Excel, and HTML formats, with a variety of settings available to customize the exported data. Higher level aggregations with interpolation and custom aggregation intervals can be applied to exported data.
