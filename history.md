# History

![](./images/axibase-logo-full.png)

ATSD is developed by [Axibase Corporation](https://axibase.com/about-us/), a privately owned company established in 2004 and headquartered in Cupertino, CA, USA.

We have over a decade of experience in infrastructure management systems, big data, and analytics. With ATSD, we sought to build a specialized database with a focus on data quality and performance where time series data is treated like a first-class citizen.
