# History

ATSD is developed by [Axibase Corporation](https://axibase.com/about-us/), established in 2004, based on our decade-long experience with IT infrastructure management systems. We sought to build a specialized database with a focus on data quality where historical data was treated like a first-class citizen. More specifically, ATSD was designed to overcome challenges with write-heavy warehouse systems such as [Tivoli DW](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4EKN_7.2.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/install/tdw_overview.htm), which suffered from all kinds of data collection issues.

## Prototype

* A prototype was ready by June 2013.
* An MVP was released in October 2013.
* The first licensed ATSD instance was delivered to a customer in mid-2014.
