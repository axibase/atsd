# History

ATSD is developed by [Axibase Corporation](https://axibase.com/about-us/), established in 2004, based on our decade-long experience with IT infrastructure management systems. We aim to build a specialized database with a focus on data quality where historical data is treated as a first-class citizen. More specifically, ATSD is designed to overcome challenges with write-heavy warehouse systems such as [Tivoli DW](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4EKN_7.2.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3/install/tdw_overview.htm), which suffer from intrinsic data collection and data quality issues.

## Prototype

* Prototype ready by June 2013.
