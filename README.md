# Introduction

Axibase Time Series Database (ATSD) is a non-relational database optimized for collecting, storing, and analyzing temporal data from IT infrastructure, industrial equipment, smart meters, and IoT devices.

## Technology Stack

```elm
ATSD
 |
HBase
 |
FileSystem: Local / HDFS / EMRFS
```

* ATSD is written in Java. It is supported on Linux distributions in 64-bit mode and requires a Java 8 runtime environment.
* Underneath ATSD is [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/) which persists key-values in the underlying file system such as `ext4`, [Hadoop Distributed File System](./installation/cloudera.md) (HDFS), and [Amazon EMRFS](./installation/aws-emr-s3.md).

ATSD can be installed from `deb` and `rpm` [packages](./installation/README.md#packages) or launched as a Docker [container](./installation/docker.md#start-container).

## Compute Scalability

Single-node ATSD instance can process up to 200,000 metrics per second with millisecond accuracy, support for out-of-order writes, and without numeric precision loss.

Number of metrics inserted per second is scaled by adding **region servers** to the underlying HBase cluster.

## Storage Scalability

Storage efficiency determines how many metrics and individual series can be stored in the system.

Compared to traditional databases, ATSD requires up to **50 times** less disk space. Refer to [compression tests](./administration/compaction/README.md) for more details.

Storage capacity can be scaled by adding data nodes to the underlying HDFS cluster. In ATSD on [AWS EMR](./installation/aws-emr-s3.md), the storage capacity is right-sized automatically and independently of the processing capacity.

## Use Cases

* High-performance metrics backend.
* Consolidated statistics repository.
* Centralized monitoring system.
* EDM database.
* Data Lake component for time series data.
* Econometrics data store.

## Components

ATSD is a modular systems which includes the following components in addition to the core storage engine:

* [REST API](./api/data/README.md) Server
* [Network API](./api/network/README.md) Server
* [CSV Processor](./parsers/csv/README.md)
* [Rule Engine](./rule-engine/README.md)
* [SQL Engine](./sql/README.md)
* [Search Engine](./search/README.md)
* [Portal Server](./portals/README.md)

## Inserting Data

* Upload CSV.
* Stream CSV.
* Stream network commands via TCP/UDP.
* Stream network commands with Kafka.
* Insert data using REST API.
* Insert rows using [JDBC driver](https://github.com/axibase/atsd-jdbc/blob/master/insert.md).
* Use API clients or storage drivers.
* Install pre-integrated collectors/agents.
* Deploy [Axibase Collectors](https://axibase.com/docs/axibase-collector/).

## Line Protocols

The database provides an optimized line protocol for inserting high volumes of metrics with user-defined dimensions called [network commands](api/network/README.md).

```bash
echo "series e:sns-001 m:temperature=15.4 m:rpm=302 t:panel=front" \
  > /dev/tcp/atsd_hostname/8081
```

The commands can be streamed into ATSD on ports `8081/tcp`, port `8082/udp` or uploaded to the [`/api/v1/command`](api/data/ext/command.md) REST API endpoint.

The following protocols are supported for extended compatibility:

* [`tcollector`](api/network/tcollector.md)
* [`graphite`](api/network/graphite.md)
* [`statsd`](api/network/statsd.md)
* [`osisoft pi`](api/network/picomp2.md)

## Schema

New entities and metrics are registered automatically and allow collecting data from different domain models in a single extensible schema.

The list of underlying tables is displayed on the **Settings > Storage > Database Tables** page. The table schemas are self-managed by the database.

### Glossary

* `Entity`: Name of the object being monitored.
* `Metric`: Name of the numeric attribute describing the object.
* `Sample`: Timestamped metric value, `time:number`.
* `Series`: Sequence of Samples.
* `Tag`: Custom attribute describing the `Entity`, `Metric`, or `Series`, consists of a name and a value, `name:value`.

### Example

To store some temperature observations for bioreactor `BR1740` enclosure located at site `SVL2` in Sunnyvale, as well as room temperature at the same site, send these commands into ATSD.

Metadata commands contain descriptive attributes and can be sent only once, or whenever these attributes change.

```elm
entity e:BR1740 t:type=Bioreactor t:city=Sunnyvale t:site=SVL2
entity e:SVL2   t:type=site       t:city=Sunnyvale
metric m:Temperature t:units=Celsius
```

The series commands carry the actual measurements and contain only those attributes that are necessary to identify the series.

```elm
series d:2018-05-20T00:15:00Z e:BR1740 m:Temperature=70.5 t:part=enclosure
series d:2018-05-20T00:15:00Z e:SVL2   m:Temperature=25.2
series d:2018-05-20T00:16:00Z e:BR1740 m:Temperature=72.5 t:part=enclosure
series d:2018-05-20T00:16:00Z e:SVL2   m:Temperature=25.1
...
```

By separating inserted data into metadata and time series data, each type of information can stored and processed separately and efficiently. At the same time, both types of data are readily available and efficiently joined when querying the records from the database.

```sql
SELECT datetime, value, entity, entity.tags.type
  FROM atsd_series
WHERE metric = 'Temperature'
  AND entity = 'BR1740'
  ORDER BY datetime
```
